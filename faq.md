## Concepts

### What is delegated proof of stake (dPOS)?

Ark uses the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus system that was first introduced by BitShares. This consensus algorithm was designed to eliminate the issues associated with Proof of Work (PoW), namely the centralization of computing power and the exponentially increasing waste of real world energy. While not completely decentralized as it relies on consensus by a fixed number of elected delegates, it guarantees a better decentralization than Bitcoin. The consensus algorithm implementation is improved over time, evolving into an optimal consensus system.

### What is a SmartBridge?

The ARK Platform does not provide direct support for sidechains or dapp databases. Instead, a mechanism to bridge together blockchains is provided via a bridging function built into ARK Core where any blockchain can send and receive trigger function notices and informational data through the primary ARK network via custom developed SmartBridge(s) and Encoded Listeners.

### How do you mine Ark? What is forging?

Mining is called forging in Ark. The 51 elected delegates can forge new Ark with their network nodes.

### How do I become a delegate?

You have to register as a delegate and get enough votes to join the top 51 delegates.

### How do I vote?

Each wallet can cast a vote on a delegate. The delegate will receive votes aaccording to the balance of the voter's wallets.

### How can I make profit if I am not a delegate?

Some delegates pass on profits to their voters. Profit sharing is optional and up to the agreement between delegate and voter.
