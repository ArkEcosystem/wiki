# ARK - Connecting to ARKEcosystem on github

TODO LINK TO SOME ARK HEADER PHOTO

As a fully open source project, ARK will live and die by itâ€™s community contributions. We truly believe that the future of the ARK Ecosystem depends on a strong collaborative effort between the ARK Crew and our open source developers and designers. As such, we want to promote and encourage community contributions to all aspects of the project.
In order to start contributing to community, firstly you need to pull our code and start learning/playing with it.


# GIT basics of and the available tooling
- Take a look at this awesome rogerdudler.github.io **no deep shit guide** from Roger Dudler. It will take you thru the installation process and explain all you need to know to start using git
- Install GIT client on your computer (see the above guide on how to accomplish this)
- [Optionally] Install GUI Git client. You can select from:
- - GitHub Desktop https://desktop.github.com/
- - Atlassian SourceTree https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/
- - Tortoise GIT https://tortoisegit.org/

# Accessing ARK ecosystem code
A list of avaiable ARK project/repositories is accesible here: https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/. 
- Select a project
- Fork to project (you will need to be signed-in to github to acomplish this)
- Clone the project you just forked (omg - how many stranged words:))
- Start working and viewing, editing the code.

# Contributing the code to ARk ecosystem
Let's say you found a bug, or a simple code correction suggestion. You have already tested it on your local environment, but you would also love to share it with the community (don't forget the bounty:)). To acomplish this:
- Commit your local repository changes with explanations - why you did this
- Push the changes to your fork of Ark project
- Create a new pull request between ArkEcosystem git project and you personal project fork

# Keeping your fork up to date
