# ARK - Connecting to ARKEcosystem on github

TODO LINK TO SOME ARK HEADER PHOTO

As a fully open source project, ARK will live and die by itâ€™s community contributions. We truly believe that the future of the ARK Ecosystem depends on a strong collaborative effort between the ARK Crew and our open source developers and designers. As such, we want to promote and encourage community contributions to all aspects of the project.
In order to start contributing to community, firstly you need to pull our code and start learning/playing with it.


# First steps!
- Get familliar with GIT (a distribted source control system). Check out this no deep shit guide here: http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/ 
- Install GIT client on your computer (see the above guide on how to accomplish this)

And here's some code! :+1:

```javascript
$(function(){
  $('div').html('I am a div.');
});
```
